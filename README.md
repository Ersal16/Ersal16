# Hello everyone
## I'mm Salmo, a 16 years old italian beginner developer
I started coding when i was 14, i still have much to learn.
I spend about 3-4 hours a day coding, but sometimes I lose the track of time and I end up turning off my computer at 3am




## Languages i'm familiar with/im learning:
### **Python**
  - I worked a lot on telegram bots and minigames
  - I'm familiar with Kivy and KivyMD
  - I'm planning to learn data science with Python
 
### **C++**
  - currently I only develop console apps but I'm planning to start using frameworks

### **C#**
  - Still learning C# and Unity

### **Dart (on hold)**
  - I started learning dart for flutter, but I ended up learning Kivy

### **HTML, CSS, JS**
  - These are the languages that i know better
  - I practiced by recreating the frontend of popular websites and this helped me a lot


I usually work on projects related to anime
